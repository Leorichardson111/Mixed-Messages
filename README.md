# Mixed-Messages

## Summary

This project is part of Codecademy's Full-Stack and Back-End Engineer career paths. The simple project is meant to give practice in JavaScript, Version Control (GitHub), and command line.

## Project Instructions

For this project, you will build a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. Youâ€™re welcome to take the project in a couple of different forms, like an astrology generator, inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. To make your program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data. Take what you know of JavaScript syntax so far to build the program and customize it to your liking.

## Project Objectives:

* Build a message generator program using JavaScript
* Use Git version control
* Use command line
* Develop locally on your computer

## Prerequisites:

* JavaScript
* Git and GitHub
* Command line

## My Idea

I will make a javascript program which tells a random 'good joke', 'bad joke' and 'ugly joke'.
I will use 3 separate arrays for each type of joke.
I will then create a function that:
* creates a randomly generated number (less than the array length)
* this will correspond to the index number of the joke that will be displayed
* inside the function I will console.log the given random joke for each TYPE of joke

the last line of code will be the running of the last function, this will then print the 3 random jokes.
